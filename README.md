# c_serv - simple C server

> :hand: Still highly unfinished... Currently acts only as a echo server and consumes stupendous amounts of CPU firepower.

A simple C based HTTP server for UNIX based operating systems implemented using thread groups/pools.

## Setup

* Clone repo

* Run `make` inside repo

* Run the server using `./serv`

## Disclaimer

**Note:** This project is more academically inclined (it's sort of a implementation of whatever I've learnt over this semester (both in my C based CS classes and self taught stuff). Topics implemented in the project:

* Pointers/memory management
* Datastructures (Queue)
* Basic socket programming (self taught)
* Threads/pthreads (self taught)
